# ðŸ’Ž Jewel Jaws ðŸ”ª
A simple mod that adds a creature of the depths that uses ores for sustenance.
# ðŸ”ª Entity concept
Adds a creepy and greedy creature that will get annoyed when players mine ores near it,
trying to steal their loot as well as their lives.
# ðŸ”§ Amethyst Heart
However killing the entity can be useful since it gives an item that can be used to detect ores in a large area, making mining easier.
But each entity killed will make the next entity harder to kill.
# Credits and Inspiration! âœ¨
Very much inspired in Gargin's Cave Dweller

- [Cave Dweller on curseforge]()

As well as the video on minecraft horror done by [Daggz](https://www.youtube.com/@Daggz)

- [Minecraft "Horror Mods" are Missing the Point](https://youtu.be/u9goa5zSysk)

The concept of the creature is also somewhat based on the crystal area from Hollow knight,
as well as its designed boss from that area.(Mainly in the thought of something adding gems into their body)
